                            Any vinyl collector knows the pain of going through their collection every once in a while and
                            trying to figure out what genre is
                            what or what year a tune is?
                            You try with your wee pieces of paper or card to seperate certain groups of vinyl apart but these
                            don't last very long then
                            it's back to having a whole bunch of vinyl.
                            Well have no fear cause My Vinyl Anwser is here !
                            It will keep track of your very personal vinyl collection where you can create, read, update and
                            delete your way to vinyl heaven.
                            Slide through your vinyl collection wherever or whenever you want and don't forget to check your
                            collection before you buy another
                            copy of that awesome tune that you've already bought 3 times.
                            Anyways, I hope you like it ..... peace out !
