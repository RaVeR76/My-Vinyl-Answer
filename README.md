## **Project Goals**

I'm a DJ (mainly a Bedroom one though .... see my MS1 project ha ha) & have been DJing for 25 years. I do it because I love the music, I love the people and I love the feeling of making people smile through the freedom of my sets :)
I have hundreds of records, aka Vinyl, which I have been collecting from the mid 90s to now and I am still buying them .... it's like an addiction to be honest !
I've tried to attend V.A. classes (Vinyl Anonymous) but they will never change me so I may just try to keep track of what I am buying and why .....
This is were my idea for a project comes from. I don't know how many records I have, I don't know what genre they are when I look at them, obviously I know some like the classics, but the majority I need to play before I can ascertain what genre they are. The amount of times I have went through my whole record selection to try and get some sort of order and organistaion is completely criminal and so time consuming it's unreal. 
Again, this is were my project comes in ! I want to have a once and for all list of my personal vinyl and as much information per record as possible which I can search and hopefully help my keep track of .... I may even add a random function to help me select some cool SETS to play from the various Genres I have :)

### **User Requirements and Expectations**

#### Requirements 

* Single page portfolio design
* Ease of navigation
* An aesthetically pleasing website
* Easy to perform CRUD operations (Admin)
* Developers creditials up to date
* Contact form
* Admin access for various functions
* A little uniqueness to hopefully stand out a little bit more


#### Expectations

* To enjoy the website layout and navigate freely with no issues
* To know a little bit more about the developer
* Contact options in case the user wants to offer employment or projects
* As an Admin, to be able to access the Database and make changes easily


### **Design Choices**

I will be using Bootstrap 4 to create the overall layout of my website, as this will make it easier for me to control it's functionality across multiple devices.
I just want it to be a simple and easy on the eye .... nothing too adventurous or loud !
It will be a one page scrolling website split into various sections, each displaying certain information about the developer.



#### Fonts

For my fonts, I am going to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as my source of inspiration :)
I have settled on the simplicity side of things & the more user friendly style of [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway)
for the main text and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for titles and section headings.

Below is an example of my fonts where the title is in ***Roboto*** and the text is in ***Raleway*** .....

![Thee-Profile Fonts]()


#### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require. 
I will deffo be using the various programming language icons and some social media icons on my website.
Other than them, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.


#### Colours

I love happy, bright, vibriant colours to be honest as I am an ex-raver and generally a chilled out happy go lucky person 
(I had to use the term *generally* because of JavaScript ha ha .... deffo lost a few hairs over that one).
Anyway, I don't want to make this website too loud and off putting but I want the colours to have like a chilled out vibriant feel, if you get what I mean.
Basically not too bright but not to dull either .... still confused, yeah me too ! I think AMBIENT is the keyword I'm looking for here :)  

So the colours I have mainly settled for are :

|Name                  |Hex Code   |Basic Description  |Usage                           |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
|***Cultured***        |#F5F5F5    |Off White          |Body background, text & titles  |
|***Blizzard Blue***   |#A1EAF7    |Light Sky Blue     |Body background                 |
|***Fuzzy Wuzzy***     |#E36464    |Bubblegum Pink     |Body background                 |
|***Smoky Black***     |#110303    |Off Black          |Body background, text & titles  |

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....

## **Wireframes**
---
The software that I used for my wireframes was Balsamiq. This was the third time I used this software & it was deffo a lot easier to understand what you need to do. The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile. They are just simple 2D sketches but I now understand how important these really are:)

Anyway, you can have a wee look at my wireframes below:
