## **Project Goals**

I'm a DJ (mainly a Bedroom one though .... see my MS1 project ha ha) & have been DJing for 25 years. I do it because I love the music, I love the people and I love the feeling of making people smile through the freedom of my sets :)
I have hundreds of records, aka Vinyl, which I have been collecting from the mid 90s to now and I am still buying them .... it's like an addiction to be honest !
I've tried to attend V.A. classes (Vinyl Anonymous) but they will never change me so I may just try to keep track of what I am buying and why .....
This is were my idea for a project comes from. I don't know how many records I have, I don't know what genre they are when I look at them, obviously I know some like the classics, but the majority I need to play before I can ascertain what genre they are. The amount of times I have went through my whole record selection to try and get some sort of order and organistaion is completely criminal and so time consuming it's unreal. 
Again, this is were my project comes in ! I want to have a once and for all list of my personal vinyl and as much information per record as possible which I can search and hopefully help my keep track of .... I may even add a random function to help me select some cool SETS to play from the various Genres I have :)

### **User Requirements and Expectations**

#### Requirements 

* Multi page design

* An aesthetically pleasing website
* Easy to perform CRUD operations on each vinyl stored in their database
* Contact form for contacting the developer with any bugs or future suggestions to make the site better
* A little uniqueness to hopefully stand out a little bit more

* To enjoy the website layout and navigate freely with no issues
* Be able to search my vinyl collection by the various attributes 
* Contact options in case the user has found some bugs that need fixing
* For the user to be able to access their personal collection / database and make changes easily


### **Design Choices**

I am going to slip out of my comfort zone with this project and I'm going to use the framework Bulma, on the recommendation of my mentor.
He wants me to push myself and try new things so I'll give it a go for sure.
I just want it to be a simple and easy on the eye .... nothing too adventurous or loud !
It will be a multi page website so that the user can click between pages to utilise the full atonomy of my design :)
I will be using MongoDB as the database for my application as I found it fairly easy to use and have some knowledge of it now.


#### Fonts

For my fonts, I am going to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as my source of inspiration :)
I have settled on the simplicity side of things & the more user friendly style of [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web)
for the main text and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for titles and section headings.

Below is an example of my fonts where the title is in ***Titillium*** and the text is in ***Roboto*** .....

![My-Vinyl-Answer Fonts](https://github.com/RaVeR76/My-Vinyl-Answer/raw/master/wireframes/fonts-example.png)


#### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require. 
I will deffo be using the various basic icons and some music icons on my website.
Other than them, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.


#### Colours

I love happy, bright, vibriant colours to be honest as I am an ex-raver and generally a chilled out happy go lucky person 
(I had to use the term *generally* because of JavaScript ha ha .... deffo lost a few hairs over that one).
Anyway, I don't want to make this website too loud and off putting but I want the colours to have like a chilled out vibriant feel, if you get what I mean.
Basically not too bright but not to dull either .... still confused, yeah me too ! I think AMBIENT is the keyword I'm looking for here :)  

So the colours I have mainly settled for are :

|Name                  |Hex Code   |Basic Description  |Usage                           |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
|***Cultured***        |#F5F5F5    |Off White          |Body background, text & titles  |
|***Blizzard Blue***   |#A1EAF7    |Light Sky Blue     |Body background                 |
|***Fuzzy Wuzzy***     |#E36464    |Bubblegum Pink     |Body background                 |
|***Smoky Black***     |#110303    |Off Black          |Body background, text & titles  |

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....

## **Wireframes**
---
The software that I used for my wireframes was Balsamiq. This was the third time I used this software & it was deffo a lot easier to understand what you need to do. The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile. They are just simple 2D sketches but I now understand how important these really are :) 
I think my wireframes look good & deffo give me a great starting point for the design process !

Anyway, you can have a wee look at my wireframes below:

## **Testing**

### EnVINYLoment

#### User Story : I want to be able to login so I can have my own personal environment or enVINYLoment as I like to call it (sorry that was bad)

* **Plan**  
I want to create a website that is unique to each person and allows them to feel welcome everytime they log on.
The user will first have to sign up with some basic details which will be added to their personal user database.
After this, each user will have a personal username which will be one of a kind, as I will add code to eliminate duplication.
They will have access to their own vinyl collection which they will have to build from scratch themselves obviously, unless I'm
some kinda vinyl stalker who knows what each user has in their record boxes or attics !
I may possibly add some sort of a simple profile pic code that the user can utilise to add a URL link for their profile pic (save db space plus keeps it simple)

In production, you could probably give the user the ability to delete their profile if they wanted to but I will add Admin Access to the website
for the ability to delete users.

 JavaScript for a Bulma select dropdown taken from here - https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/1870

Couldn't get dropdown border colour to change to my-blue which did my head in tbh . I tried everything but couldn't get it to work ......
until I remembered something !important (pun inteneded) ..... this solved my issue as the 'select' class was overruling all my tries !!!

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_delete_modal.asp - Delete Confirmation Model


tried to add jquery for calling the modal when you clicked on the 'delete button' but it wouldn't work.
It worked when I used say a class = p1 but not an id = p1 .... couldn't figure it out for ages .... did my head absolutely in tnh
but then i realised I was created id = p1 numourous times as it was within a for loop so therefore it was pissed off because there should only one 'id' & thats why it wouldn't work .... glad I figured it out tbh :)



I couldn't get my modal to delete the correct db file & it would just delete the first one in the list.
The selected vinyl_id wasn't linking to my delete route.
SO I moved the modal to it's own page & created an app.route to it when the delete button is pressed.
ANd I pass through the vinyl details using vinyl_id.
so I can display any vinyl details I want plus pass the vinyl_id onto the delete route.



Spent ages trying to figure out why my users database values would not display on my profile page as per user
I was using jinja logic to display them but forgot to write the database name with each value i.e. {{ fullname }} should have been {{ users.fullname }}
Pretty raging after that tbh but sure .... another learning poiunt noted & will be easier to notice next time !


email validation wasn't working .... I had type="text" instead of type="email"
