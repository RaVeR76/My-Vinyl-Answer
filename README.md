## **Project Goals**

I'm a DJ (mainly a Bedroom one though .... see my MS1 project ha ha) & have been DJing for 25 years. I do it because I love the music, I love the people and I love the feeling of making people smile through the freedom of my sets :)
I have hundreds of records, aka Vinyl, which I have been collecting from the mid 90s to now and I am still buying them .... it's like an addiction to be honest !
I've tried to attend V.A. classes (Vinyl Anonymous) but they will never change me so I may just try to keep track of what I am buying and why .....
This is were my idea for a project comes from. I don't know how many records I have, I don't know what genre they are when I look at them, obviously I know some like the classics, but the majority I need to play before I can ascertain what genre they are. The amount of times I have went through my whole record selection to try and get some sort of order and organistaion is completely criminal and so time consuming it's unreal. 
Again, this is were my project comes in ! I want to have a once and for all list of my personal vinyl and as much information per record as possible which I can search and hopefully help my keep track of .... I may even add a random function to help me select some cool SETS to play from the various Genres I have :)

[Back to Top](#contents)

### **User Requirements and Expectations**

#### Requirements 

* Multi page design
* Ease of navigation
* An aesthetically pleasing website
* Easy to perform CRUD operations on each vinyl stored in their database
* Contact form for contacting the developer with any bugs or future suggestions to make the site better
* A little uniqueness to hopefully stand out a little bit more

* To enjoy the website layout and navigate freely with no issues
* Be able to search my vinyl collection by the various attributes 
* Contact options in case the user has found some bugs that need fixing
* For the user to be able to access their personal collection / database and make changes easily


### **Design Choices**

I am going to slip out of my comfort zone with this project and I'm going to use the framework Bulma, on the recommendation of my mentor.
He wants me to push myself and try new things so I'll give it a go for sure.
I just want it to be a simple and easy on the eye .... nothing too adventurous or loud !
It will be a multi page website so that the user can click between pages to utilise the full atonomy of my design :)
I will be using MongoDB as the database for my application as I found it fairly easy to use and have some knowledge of it now.


#### Fonts

For my fonts, I am going to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as my source of inspiration :)
I have settled on the simplicity side of things & the more user friendly style of [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web)
for the main text and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for titles and section headings.

Below is an example of my fonts where the title is in ***Titillium*** and the text is in ***Roboto*** .....

![My-Vinyl-Answer Fonts](https://github.com/RaVeR76/My-Vinyl-Answer/raw/master/wireframes/fonts-example.png)


#### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require. 
I will deffo be using the various basic icons and some music icons on my website.
Other than them, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.


#### Colours

I love happy, bright, vibriant colours to be honest as I am an ex-raver and generally a chilled out happy go lucky person 
(I had to use the term *generally* because of JavaScript ha ha .... deffo lost a few hairs over that one).
Anyway, I don't want to make this website too loud and off putting but I want the colours to have like a chilled out vibriant feel, if you get what I mean.
Basically not too bright but not to dull either .... still confused, yeah me too ! I think AMBIENT is the keyword I'm looking for here :)  

So the colours I have mainly settled for are :

|Name                  |Hex Code   |Basic Description  |Usage                           |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
|***Cultured***        |#F5F5F5    |Off White          |Body background, text & titles  |
|***Blizzard Blue***   |#A1EAF7    |Light Sky Blue     |Body background                 |
|***Fuzzy Wuzzy***     |#E36464    |Bubblegum Pink     |Body background                 |
|***Smoky Black***     |#110303    |Off Black          |Body background, text & titles  |

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....

## **Wireframes**
---
The software that I used for my wireframes was Balsamiq. This was the third time I used this software & it was deffo a lot easier to understand what you need to do. The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile. They are just simple 2D sketches but I now understand how important these really are :) 
I think my wireframes look good & deffo give me a great starting point for the design process !

Anyway, you can have a wee look at my wireframes below:

## **Testing**
---

### Do You Know Reggie Star?

#### User Story : I want to be able to register for my own account

* **Plan**  
I want the user to have the ability to register for My Vinyl Answer so they can log in anytime in the future with ease.
I will create a register form where they will have to input their full name, a username, a email address and a password. 
There will be a Sign Up button available which will POST the data to the database. 
I will add some defensive programming so that usernames will not be duplicated. I will check to see if the new username already exists in the database and if so flash up a an alert but if not then render their profile page. This will be populated with the information they just input and also a welcome message will appear ... obviously I will not be displaying their **password** within their profile or anywhere in fact ha ha !



* **Implementation**  
Password will be encripted by using hash method --- elaborate

* **Test**  


* **Result**  


* **Verdict** 




### EnVINYLoment Tut Tut

#### User Story : I want to be able to login so I can have my own personal environment or enVINYLoment as I like to call it (sorry that was bad)

* **Plan**  
I want to create a website that is unique to each person and allows them to feel welcome everytime they log on.
The user will first have to sign up with some basic details which will be added to their personal user database.
After this, each user will have a personal username which will be one of a kind, as I will add code to eliminate duplication.
They will have access to their own vinyl collection which they will have to build from scratch themselves obviously, unless I'm
some kinda vinyl stalker who knows what each user has in their record boxes or attics !
I may possibly add some sort of a simple profile pic code that the user can utilise to add a URL link for their profile pic (save db space plus keeps it simple)

In production, you could probably give the user the ability to delete their profile if they wanted to but I will add Admin Access to the website
for the ability to delete users.

* **Implementation**  


* **Test**  


* **Result**  


* **Verdict**  




### A Record Of Records

#### User Story : I want to be able to know what vinyl I have collected over the years

* **Plan**  
Maybe it's just me that has an issue with keeping track of my vinyl but I know I have mates that are like me. Vinyl everywhere and they 
generally don't know how many they have, what genre they are or what year they came out. I have seen some really well organised vinyl but these were
basically like alphabetically but by genre. I just want the user to have a simple database of all their vinyl, that they can call upon using my application.
The hard part is adding all the vinyl at the start but once it's done .... it's done !  
I wish there was an easier way like scanning the barcode or something but some of these vinyls are pretty oldish and I honestlty don't kmnow if the barcode would 
work or not. I'm now kinda intrigued to see if it would work anyway for possible a future add on :) I'll come back to that one and let you know sure !
The point being that I want the user to be able to add, delete, lookup and edit any of their own personal vinyl collection as and when required.
The database will store the name, the artist, the genre, the label, a brief description and the release year. 
I may add admin access where they can add new catagories to the databases and edit user profiles etc. You may wonder why a user can't do this for themselves but
I just want the admin to do it for the purposes of this project. In production, you could write the code to allow a user the ability to add an extra 3 
personal database fields with a certain amount of characters per field, make it a little more personal to the user :)
Anyway, it's a simple database that the user can salivate over anytime or anywhere .... as long as they have a computer or mobile device ... with internet of course ha ha !


* **Implementation**  


* **Test**  


* **Result**  


* **Verdict**  




### Finding Nemo 

#### User Story : I want to list my vinyl collection by genre or year which are the most important aspects as a DJ .... (or by any attribute possibly)

* **Plan**  
I want the user to be able to search through their personal vinyl collection by genre or release year at the very least but possibly more.
Although I said in the title that this would be good for a DJ, it would still be a great option for any vinyl enthusiast .... the ablity to search their
collection. Why, you may ask? Well, I'll give you my main reason .... duplication !!!   
The amount of times I have bought a vinyl or even a CD that I already feckin had is criminal, although the sound is amazing with two identical tunes playing on the decks
and the beats are cancelling each other out and all. It creates so many emotions when you realise your mistake .... anger, this cost me money .... laughter, can't believe I was so stupid .... worry, jeez my memory is so awful .... happiness, the 90s was so unbelievably awesome and you felt free ..... laughter again, cause I realise that I can't remember what I watched an hour ago on TV but I can remember the 90s :)
So for me to check if you already have that vinyl you are watching on ebay or Discogs would be a good reason.
Also music has changed through the ages so maybe the user is in the mood for a 70s themed evening and isn't sure what 70s songs they have. 
Alexa aka My Vinyl Answer ... what list of vinyls have I from the 1970's? BANG! Search code activated and VOILA !!! ... Your list of 70s classic at your fingertips.


* **Implementation**  


* **Test**  


* **Result**  


* **Verdict**  





### Rate My Plate .... I Mean Vinyl

#### User Story : I want to be able to rate my vinyl as they are not all as good as the next one

* **Plan**  
I really want a five star system but this may add too much complexity to my overall code .... I will give it a try though so do not panic but worse case scenario, 
I'll add some sort of one to five rating either by radios or by a simple inputting of a number. This will get added to the vinyl database along with any other information you've added or edited. You know sometimes you could be in that 5 star mode where you want all the tunes to be banging or maybe you want to hear some of the more messed
up tuneage that you bought by lowering your standards and selecting the one star-ers. The more I talk about this project the more I wish I could add the songs as well and play them on your device ... but I'm oldskool and so is vinyl, fortunately !!!
Anyway, the main point is that some of my vinyl tunes are so beautiful, so euphoric and bring back so many good memories to me that it would bring a tear to a glass eye.
On the other hand though .... I have some vinyl tunes that the devil himself would call sadistically sh!t to be quite honest.


* **Implementation**  


* **Test**  


* **Result**  


* **Verdict**  



### You are here -->o

#### User Story : I want the website to be easy to use

* **Plan**  
I want the user to be able to move from page to page with ease. I want an easy to use database system that is understandable just from the layout.
I am going to use the framework Bulma for assisting with my layout and css. I have used Bootstrap in my first two projects so under direction from my legendary mentor, I will be utilising The Bulma Frameowrk. 
It looks pretty awesome and will deffo have it's challenges, as did Bootstrap to be fair but I'm here to learn and become a better coder every day :)
I have so many great ideas but I deffo lack knowledge and lack time unfortunately ..... I do know this will get better over time, with constant developing and total commitment.
I want the website to work on all devices which I believe Bulma will be a great help with. I want the user to be able to freely navigate to where ever they want but within the confines of **My Vinyl Answer**, of course !


* **Implementation**  


* **Test**  


* **Result**  


* **Verdict**



### Describe Me In Five Words

#### User Story : I want to possibly add a description or some specific notes attached to each vinyl, if required

* **Plan**  
I want the user to be able to add a small description about each specific vinyl. Whether that's a few words about a song on it or the condition of the vinyl itself.
For example, this is an Ibiza style trance tune or this is happy hardcore at it's finest, and it's always good to know if there is a small scratch, some warping 
or possibly some sleeve damage too. This will also be useful information if you are ever looking to sell a vinyl on Discogs (Disclaimer - other vinyl sales websites are available) and you will probably have the main information already in My Vinyl Answer. Although selling vinyl should be made a criminal offence to be fair .... but that would mean I wouldn't have been able to buy any .... which would mean I have lost my passion !!! Okay scrap that, I meant to say selling vinyl should be a crime .... unless you are selling to me, ha ha, much better :)


* **Implementation**  


* **Test**  


* **Result**  


* **Verdict**



### You Spent Our Life Savings On A Vinyl Job Lot

#### User Story : I want to be able to add as many vinyls as I want

* **Plan**  
I want the user to be able to add as much vinyl as they want and with total ease. 

The user will be able select this option from the navbar once they have logged in or registered.
I will entail a simple form with the required inputs for the user to fill out.
They can then submit the new vinyl information for storing in their personal accessible database. I will then flash up a notification to say that they have been successful
with their vinyl collection incrementation and redirect back them to their **My Vinyl** page .... simples !

* **Implementation**  


* **Test**  


* **Result**  


* **Verdict**



### The Vinyl Edit Before It Goes To Press

#### User Story : I want to edit any vinyl info if I want

* **Plan**  
I want the user to be able to edit any vinyl information on any individual vinyl document in the database. They will be able to access the **Edit Vinyl** page from the 
**My Vinyl** page by clicking the edit button hidden within each of the vinyls collapsibles. Once on the Edit Vinyl page the user will have access to a pre-loaded form with the current vinyl information already filled in. The user can then edit whatever section they want and when they are happy, they can submit again to the database the editted vinyl info. Once this is complete I will redirect them back to their **My Vinyl** page again where they can check on their current updated vinyl. I'm just thinking that if the user has a large collection and they edit after scrolling down through a lot of them, if they decide to edit at this point, will a redirectiion send the user back to the top of the list??? I'll have to think about this one and test to see what happens :)

* **Implementation**  


* **Test**  


* **Result**  


* **Verdict**



### Deletion Will Be My Vinyl Option

#### User Story : I want to delete any vinyl I want (if I sell one personally or on another site)

* **Plan**  
I want the user to be able to delete any vinyl that they want. 
Why would they do that, you may ask? Well maybe they have grew up, unlike me, and they want to have babies, settle down and live a vinyl free life !
Life can be cruel so they will have to sell their vinyl collection .... could be a slow and painful sale were they slip from youir grasp in ones and twos ... or it could be a highest bid f'ing wins the f'ing lot :(
Anyhow enough gibber jabber fool, there will therefore be a button of the deletion family required. This delete button will be also be hidden within each of the vinyls collapsibles besdie the edit button above. Once the user clicks the delete button, I will add some defensive programming to make sure this is what the user wants to do.
This will hopefully eliminate the chance of deleting a vinyl by accident or mistake. Again once the user has completed their vinyl deletion, I will redirect them back to their **My Vinyl** page where their deleted vinyl has been removed and also removed from the database.

* **Implementation**  


* **Test**  


* **Result**  


* **Verdict**

## **Conclusion**
---

I know I called this My Vinyl Answer so it't therefore mainly about vinyl and stacks of it ha ha, but this could have been further developed so the
user could make up their own personl database for whatever collection they wanted. Obviously, there would be limits put in place so they don't abuse the database ...
nobody likes a db abuser !

 JavaScript for a Bulma select dropdown taken from here - https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/1870

Couldn't get dropdown border colour to change to my-blue which did my head in tbh . I tried everything but couldn't get it to work ......
until I remembered something !important (pun inteneded) ..... this solved my issue as the 'select' class was overruling all my tries !!!

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_delete_modal.asp - Delete Confirmation Model


tried to add jquery for calling the modal when you clicked on the 'delete button' but it wouldn't work.
It worked when I used say a class = p1 but not an id = p1 .... couldn't figure it out for ages .... did my head absolutely in tnh
but then i realised I was created id = p1 numourous times as it was within a for loop so therefore it was pissed off because there should only one 'id' & thats why it wouldn't work .... glad I figured it out tbh :)



I couldn't get my modal to delete the correct db file & it would just delete the first one in the list.
The selected vinyl_id wasn't linking to my delete route.
SO I moved the modal to it's own page & created an app.route to it when the delete button is pressed.
ANd I pass through the vinyl details using vinyl_id.
so I can display any vinyl details I want plus pass the vinyl_id onto the delete route.



Spent ages trying to figure out why my users database values would not display on my profile page as per user
I was using jinja logic to display them but forgot to write the database name with each value i.e. {{ fullname }} should have been {{ users.fullname }}
Pretty raging after that tbh but sure .... another learning poiunt noted & will be easier to notice next time !


email validation wasn't working .... I had type="text" instead of type="email"


I'm just thinking that if the user has a large collection and they edit after scrolling down through a lot of them, if they decide to edit at this point, will a redirectiion send the user back to the top of the list??? I'll have to think about this one and test tio see what happens :)


Couldn't figure out how to get the profile pic in the middle of the form. So tried putting the image in the middle of 3 columns.
And making the outer columns set to auto so that the middle column and therefore the image would stay in the middle of the device !


After a mentor sesh he said it would be good to have a default image in case the users url didn't load. well I tried various pieces of caode and couldn't get anything to work on a user I had made up but didn't have a profile pic url loaded. I tried for ages then realised he didn't have a profile_pic field in his database which didn't help because I had him made up before I decided to add a profile pic for to add to their Envinylonment (if I keep saying it maybe it'll catch on ha ha). Once I added this manually to the database the code I had be trying started to work ..... happy yet angry happy yet angry !!! Anyways, I tried have another url based image as back-up but while it maybe worked the first time, it was maybe missing on a reload and then back into vision on another reload. Not sure why this was happening to be honest but I didn't want to take any cvhances so I got a smiley face from my MS1. I edited Smiley Face image in Paint3D by removing some writing and I also removed the background. I added this to my images folder and using the code ```<img src="image.png" onError="this.onerror=null;this.src='/images/noimage.gif';" />``` I added my jinja link and my default Smiley Face ..... loads everytime ye boy ye (P.S. please don't come back saying it didn't work for you ..... just lie to me and say *worked dead on RaVeR76 !*)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/92720/jquery-javascript-to-replace-broken-images?page=1&tab=votes#tab-top


I honestly don't know why this keeps happening because with my MS2 a similar UFO (Unidentified Fecking Oversight) happened during my mentor session. 
Last night he showed me his ... screen and my wee project was displaying proudly but I could see two vinyl being displayed. I was like how come there are two vinyls being diaplayed when you have't even logged in .... mind blown again. With my MS2 his cards would show the actually card underneath before he evn turned it whereas on my PC is was perfect. It was a Google vs Safari issue which I couldn't resolve and I thought this was another compatability issue. Anyway, Detective RaVeR was on the case and after some clever analysing, snooping around, interogation, I found that the culprit was none other than me .... RaVeR ! I hadn't added any *Owner* field to their individual collection document within Mongodb so my code I wrote for vinyl only to be displayed by the user would not work. Owner is a hidden field (not for display) that I use to do this and gets added when a new vinyl is added to their collection. Within the jinja for loop, I check that the current user ```session.user``` is the same as the owner ```vinyl.owner``` for each vinyl and if they are, their vinyl's will be displayed on screen.
